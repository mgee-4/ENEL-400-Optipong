An integrated hardware and software project utilizing Computer Vision to automate ping pong ball training for those lonely atheletes.

## Project Goals
This was a project to create a device to automate ping pong ball launching to practice one's recieves. It works with a Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi Camera to detect a person in frame. Then it'll shoot the ball with a random offset towards them so users have to react to each new ball. The Raspberry Pi is the main controller of the shooting hardware, which includes the spinning launcher for ball launching, a horizontally rotating stepper motor for aiming, and a solenoid to push the ping pong ball into the launcher when the wheels are spinning fast enough. We used off the shelf motor controllers and a custom PCB for power delivery.

## Design Process
- heuristic design process, move fast break fast

## Challenges and Lessons Learned
- tolerances
- turnaround time with classes and fixes
